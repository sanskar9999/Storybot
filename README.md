errors

- On line 67, you have an `elif` statement without a corresponding `if` statement. You need to add an `if` statement before the `elif` statement to check the option chosen by the user.
- On line 69, you have an indentation error. You need to indent the code block under the `elif` statement to match the indentation level of the previous code block.
- On line 71, you have a comment that says \"do something based on the option chosen\", but you have not written any code to do that. You need to write some code to handle the different outcomes of the story based on the user's choice.
- On line 73, you have an `else` statement without a corresponding `if` or `elif` statement. You need to remove the `else` statement or add an `if` or `elif` statement before it.
- On line 74, you have an indentation error. You need to indent the code block under the `else` statement to match the indentation level of the previous code block.

These are some of the errors I found in your code. There may be more errors that I did not catch, so I suggest you test your code thoroughly and use a code editor that can highlight syntax errors for you.
